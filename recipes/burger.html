        This is the perfect recipe for the BBQ! Show off your skills on the grill, to your friends; on a warm summer night with the Best Steakhouse Burger!
        Follow this simple and easy recipe that makes you look like a top level cook. While most restaurant recipes are difficult to replicate due to steakhouses blending
        different types of beef - like sirloin, chuck, and short ribs - this recipe is a much simpler yet equally delicious alternative that will utilize supermarket ground beef, panade - a mixture of bread and milk - and lots of seasoning.
        This recipe has given me the title of the burger master along my pals, they now call me "The burger conossieur." So, grab your beef, grab your apron, and lets get cooking.
