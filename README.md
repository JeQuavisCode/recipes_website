Hello! Welcome!

This will be my very first project using HTML.

I will be creating a short website that includes 3 different cooking recipes to demonstrate my understanding of various basic HTML concepts. In the future, I will re-visit this website and update it with CSS.

Please note, much of the text I use may be taken from other websites. I am not a cook. This simplifies my process and allows me to focus on coding rather than on recipes.
I will be including sources for all the recipes I use.
